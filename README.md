# Othello

A simple Othello implementation written in Unity as part of a course in video game AI. Opponent moves are selected by performing a [minmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) search with [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) across the valid moves. 

Playable in browser [here](https://aggsel.itch.io/othello).
